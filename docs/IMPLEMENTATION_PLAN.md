# tascript — Implementation Plan

> Status: **working plan — standalone configurable core**. Each slice ships a
> runnable tascript with a strict subset of the spec. Downstream projects
> integrate by configuring the public Go API, not by changing parser or
> evaluator internals.

## Why slices, not phases

The earlier draft of this document grouped delivery by component (finish the
lexer, then the parser, then the analyser, then eval). That leaves the
downstream project blocked until most of the compiler is built. Vertical
slicing inverts delivery order: every slice produces a working tascript that
the project can wire against, expose to real candle data, and report problems
with. The internal compiler architecture still keeps those layers separate.

It also forces extensibility points to be designed early. When slice 5
adds the *first* indicator, the registry API has to be sharp enough for
the *next* indicator to slot in. Same with helpers in slice 7. The result
is a language that's extendable by construction — projects can register
their own indicators and helpers against the same APIs we use internally.

## How slices interact with the spec

`SPEC.md` is the final destination. Every slice implements a strict
subset; constructs not yet supported produce a clear `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`
parse error with a pointer to the slice that will land them. Each slice
also extends the test corpus.

## Compiler architecture

Vertical slices describe delivery order, not a reason to collapse compiler
layers. The implementation should keep the classic shape:

```
source -> lexer -> parser -> static analyser -> evaluator/runtime plan
```

- **Lexer** tokenises only. It does not know language semantics.
- **Parser** builds an AST for valid syntax. This includes tascript-specific
  syntax such as `input`, `output`, `function`, blocks, statements, and Pratt
  expression parsing. It may reject malformed grammar, but it should not answer
  semantic questions.
- **Static analyser** validates declarations and names, required `Init`/`Run`,
  `emit(...)` targets and payloads, type rules, registry lookups, history
  bounds, warmup call-site discovery, and resource limits.
- **Evaluator/runtime** executes a checked program. It should not rediscover
  static facts that the analyser already proved.

Diagnostics that come from the analyser are still surfaced as `PhaseParse`
when they happen before launch/runtime. Internally, keeping syntax parsing and
static analysis separate prevents the parser from becoming a symbol table,
type checker, registry resolver, and resource planner all at once.

## Repository topology

- **`tascript/`** — public Go module. Lexer, parser, static analyser, evaluator,
  registry framework, history wrapper. **Not** data sources, **not** sinks,
  **not** ergo wiring.
- **Private project repo** — depends on `tascript` as a Go module. Owns
  the runtime host: ergo actors, real data adapters (Binance, …), real
  sink adapters (Telegram, …), the synchronizer, durable state, hot
  reload, UI.
- **`talive/`** — public Go module. Stays calc-only.
- **`tascript-history/`** — proposed split-out: the standalone history
  wrapper library introduced in slice 4. Reusable for non-tascript talive
  users. May live inside `tascript/history/` until it stabilises, then be
  promoted to its own repo.

## Public extension points

These appear progressively as slices land. Once in, they are public Go
APIs that the private project (or any downstream consumer) can register
against:

| Extension point | First slice | What it lets you add |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|
| `DataSource`     | 1 | A source of candles to wire into a declared `input` port |
| `Sink`           | 0 | A destination for emitted events, optional beside the in-memory event buffer |
| Indicator registry | 5 | Custom indicators callable as `<series>.<name>(...)` in DSL |
| Helper registry   | 7 | Custom `ns.fn(...)` helpers under existing or new namespaces |
| Resource policies | 10 | Override default limits per deployment |

The private project never modifies `tascript/`; it only registers against
these APIs.

## Configurable core

tascript is intended to build as a dedicated standalone module. The host
project configures the engine through `tascript.Config`, not by changing
parser/evaluator internals:

```go
reg := tascript.NewRegistry()
reg.RegisterType(tascript.TypeSpec{Name: "Score", Value: true, Field: true})
reg.RegisterHelper(tascript.HelperSpec{
    Namespace: "custom",
    Name:      "double",
    MinArgs:   1,
    MaxArgs:   1,
    Eval:      func(args []tascript.Value) (tascript.Value, error) { ... },
})
reg.RegisterIndicator(tascript.IndicatorSpec{
    Name:    "myIndicator",
    MinArgs: 1,
    MaxArgs: 1,
    Build:   func(args []tascript.Value) (tascript.Indicator, error) { ... },
})

prog, diags, err := tascript.CompileWithConfig(src, tascript.Config{
    Registry: reg,
    ResourceLimits: tascript.ResourceLimits{
        MaxHistoryIndex: 5000,
        MaxDiagnostics:  100,
    },
})
```

The default config registers the built-in value/input types and stdlib helpers
needed by the implemented slices. Custom registries can add:

- input/value/field type names accepted by declarations;
- helper functions under custom namespaces;
- stateful method-style indicators such as `btc.myIndicator(14)`;
- resource policies and host-specific limits.
- tuple-valued indicator outputs, whose elements behave as history-backed
  numeric `Series`.
- scalar indicators on numeric `Series` receivers, e.g.
  `btc.closes.ema(3)`.

Indicator instances are built per `(receiver, indicator name, normalised args)`
and memoized across all matching call sites. Within a tick, repeated reads of
the same configured indicator return the same value; on the next tick the
instance receives the next candle.

The parser remains registry-agnostic. Registry lookups happen in the static
analyser and evaluator, so custom names do not require grammar changes.

Launch-time wiring is also host-configurable. `DataSources` wire declared
inputs, `InputPorts` can explicitly mark custom/placeholder inputs as prepared,
and `Sinks` can deliver outputs to host-owned destinations. `DrainEvents()`
remains the built-in collection path for tests and simple embedding; hosts that
need strict output wiring can set `StrictOutputWiring`.

## Slices

### Slice 0 — Walking skeleton

**Goal:** parse and execute the smallest possible program. Project wires it
up, sees an event come out.

**Language subset:**

- Lexer + parser for: `Number` and `String` literals, identifiers,
  comments, `:` (port/field type annotations), function declarations with
  empty parameter lists, `{ }` blocks, statement-level `=` assignment.
- Top-level: `K = expr` constant declarations (literals only),
  `input <name>: <Type>` and `output <name>` declarations (see below),
  `function Init() { ... }`, `function Run() { ... }`. Both `Init` and
  `Run` mandatory.
- **Input declarations** — `input btc: CandleSeries`. The name becomes a
  read-only top-level binding; the declared type is recorded but, in this
  slice, **the binding carries no data** — it is a placeholder the runtime
  registers as "this program declared an input port of this type."
- **Output declarations** — all three §3.3 shapes parse:
  `output logs: String` (value), `output alerts { kind: String }`
  (structured; multi-line schemas allowed), and the combined
  `output x: String { price: Number }`. Field/value *types* are parsed and
  recorded but **not type-checked** in this slice (no type system yet).
- `emit(OUTPUT [, ident=expr]*)` where `OUTPUT` is a declared output
  **identifier** (not a string literal) and expressions are literals or
  references to top-level constants. Validation in this slice:
  - target must be a declared output → else `UNKNOWN_OUTPUT`;
  - `emit(...)` only inside `Run()` → else `EMIT_OUTSIDE_RUN`;
  - kwargs must match the output's declared field **names** exactly — all
    present, none extra → else `EMIT_PAYLOAD`. (Field-value *type* matching
    is deferred to slice 2, when `Bool`/comparisons bring a type system.)

**Implementation note:** Slice 0 still uses the full compiler pipeline. The
parser accepts the grammar and builds AST nodes; the static analyser enforces
the slice's currently supported subset and emits `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` for syntax
that parses but is not executable yet.

**Not yet:** indicators, helpers, history, state, conditions, types beyond
`Number`/`String`, candles, output-payload *type*-checking, launch-time
wiring validation (`INPUT_NOT_WIRED` / `OUTPUT_NOT_WIRED`).

**Lexer note — multi-line `{ }`.** §3.1 locks "newlines ignored inside an
open `(` `[` `{`", but a `{` is *also* a function body where newlines
separate statements. This slice resolves the tension at the **parser**
level (skip newlines while reading an output schema or a multi-line
`emit(...)` arg list) rather than baking a bracket-depth rule into the
lexer. Full lexer-level continuation (§3.1 / §8 gap 5) stays deferred and
the `{` ambiguity should be pinned in the spec before then.

**Public Go API:**

```go
// Compile turns source into a runnable Program.
tascript.Compile(src []byte) (*Program, []Diagnostic, error)

// A Program is launched against a wiring map keyed by port name.
prog.Inputs()  []string   // declared input port names
prog.Outputs() []string   // declared output port names

// Launch validates wiring and produces a Runner.
tascript.Launch(prog, wiring) (*Runner, error)

// Runner.Step performs one tick (the caller decides cadence).
runner.Init()
runner.Step()                  // runs Run() once
events := runner.DrainEvents() // returns []Event since last drain
```

An `Event` mirrors §2: `{ output, ts, value, data }`. In this slice `ts`
is unset (no candle clock yet) and `value` is `null` for structured
outputs.

**Project's integration test for this slice:**

```js
GREETING = "hello world"

output alerts {
  message: String
}

function Init() {}
function Run() {
  emit(alerts, message=GREETING)
}
```

Project calls `Init` then `Step` once, asserts that a single
`Event{output:"alerts", value:null, data:{"message":"hello world"}}`
came out.

---

### Slice 1 — Real candles flow

**Goal:** a candle stream reaches a program; close prices reach `emit`.

**Adds:**

- `Candle` and `CandleSeries` value types with their property surfaces
  (`.open`, `.close`, etc.; `.opens`, `.closes`, etc.; derived `.hl2`,
  `.hlc3` lazy-computed per tick).
- A declared `input <name>: CandleSeries` port now produces a real
  `CandleSeries`. The runtime feeds candles into the port each tick.
- The **lift rule** (§3.6) so `Series` in scalar context auto-extracts to
  its current value.
- Binary `+ - * / %` and unary `-` on `Number`.
- `DataSource` interface: a method that produces the next candle.

**Not yet:** history (`[n]`), comparisons, conditions, state, indicators.
Launch-time `INPUT_NOT_WIRED` remains deferred; an unwired input is still
accepted for compatibility with slice-0 placeholder declarations, but reading
it at runtime is an error.

**Public Go API addition:**

```go
type Candle struct {
    Open, High, Low, Close, Volume float64
}

type DataSource interface {
    NextCandle() (Candle, error)
}

tascript.Launch(prog, tascript.Wiring{
    DataSources: map[string]tascript.DataSource{"btc": source},
})
```

**Project's integration test:**

```js
input btc: CandleSeries

output ticks {
  price: Number
  volume: Number
}

function Init() {}
function Run() {
  emit(ticks, price=btc.closes, volume=btc.volumes)
}
```

Project feeds a synthetic 100-candle stream, asserts 100 events come out
with the right per-candle prices.

---

### Slice 2 — Conditions, Bool, comparisons

**Goal:** programs can filter when they emit.

**Adds:**

- `Bool` type, `true`/`false` literals.
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) with strict
  same-type semantics (§3.6).
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) with strict-`Bool` operands and
  short-circuit evaluation.
- `if (cond) { ... }` and `if (cond) { ... } else { ... }`.
- The full operator-precedence table from §3.6.

**Project's integration test:**

```js
THRESHOLD = 100

input btc: CandleSeries

output alerts {
  price: Number
}

function Init() {}
function Run() {
  if (btc.closes > THRESHOLD) {
    emit(alerts, price=btc.closes)
  }
}
```

---

### Slice 3 — State

**Goal:** programs can remember across ticks.

**Adds:**

- `state.*` namespace.
- Assignment to `state.X` persists; reading an unassigned `state.X` is a
  runtime error (`STATE_UNSET`).
- `Init()` is invoked once before the first `Run()` to bootstrap state.
- `math.max` and `math.min` (because almost every program with state needs
  one of them — easier to land them here than to wait for the full
  `math.*` namespace in slice 7).
- The `math` namespace identifier becomes reserved.

**Project's integration test:**

```js
COOLDOWN_BARS = 5

input btc: CandleSeries

output alerts {
  price: Number
}

function Init() {
  state.cooldown = 0
}
function Run() {
  state.cooldown = math.max(0, state.cooldown - 1)
  if (btc.closes > 100 && state.cooldown == 0) {
    emit(alerts, price=btc.closes)
    state.cooldown = COOLDOWN_BARS
  }
}
```

---

### Slice 4 — History via `[n]` + the wrapper library

**Goal:** programs can read past values. The standalone history wrapper
library is introduced as `tascript/history/` (later promotable to its own
module).

**Adds:**

- `[n]` postfix on `Series` (the operator already exists on `Tuple` once
  multi-output indicators land, but in this slice tuples aren't a value
  type yet, so `[n]` means "history" exclusively).
- Static analysis: the analyser tracks the maximum literal `n` per series and
  sizes a ring buffer accordingly (§4.2).
- `HISTORY_OUT_OF_RANGE` runtime error.
- `HISTORY_LIMIT` parse error at the 5000-bar cap (§7).
- The history wrapper abstraction: takes any per-tick value source, exposes
  `current()` and `history(n)`. It currently lives inside the standalone core;
  if non-tascript users need it, split it out as `tascript-history`.

**Project's integration test:**

```js
input btc: CandleSeries

output alerts {
  curr: Number
  prev: Number
}

function Init() {}
function Run() {
  if (btc.closes > btc.closes[1]) {
    emit(alerts, curr=btc.closes, prev=btc.closes[1])
  }
}
```

---

### Slice 5 — First indicator (EMA) + indicator registry

**Goal:** real TA reaches the DSL. The indicator registry API ships,
designed for the second indicator to slot in without changes.

**Adds:**

- Method-style indicator calls on `CandleSeries`: `btc.ema(50)`.
- Indicator registry public API:
  ```go
  type IndicatorSpec struct {
      Name       string
      Positional []ParamType
      Kwargs     map[string]KwargSpec
      IsScalar   bool                   // true means callable on Series too
      Build      func(args) talive.Indicator
  }
  reg.RegisterIndicator(spec IndicatorSpec) error
  ```
- The registry is open: the private project can `RegisterIndicator(...)`
  its own indicators against tascript at launch.
- EMA can be registered by a talive adapter package or the host project. The
  standalone core includes a small default EMA so the first-indicator path is
  usable without private-project wiring.
- **Warmup phase:** the analyser enumerates every indicator call site, runtime
  computes `max(WarmUpPeriod)`, requests that many historical candles from
  the `DataSource`, feeds them through, then begins live `Run()`.
- Indicator-output `Series` go through the history wrapper from slice 4
  for `[n]` support.
- Memoisation by `(receiver, indicator_class, normalised_args)` (§5.1).

**Project's integration test:**

```js
input btc: CandleSeries

output alerts {
  price: Number
  ema: Number
}

function Init() {}
function Run() {
  if (btc.closes > btc.ema(50)) {
    emit(alerts, price=btc.closes, ema=btc.ema(50))
  }
}
```

---

### Slice 6 — Indicator surface fills in

**Goal:** the bulk of talive becomes reachable.

**Adds:**

- Scalar indicators: `rsi`, `sma`, `smma`, `wma`, `dema`, `tema` (all the
  ones implementing talive's `Scalar` interface).
- Non-scalar / multi-output: `macd`, `bb`, `atr`, `dmi` — return values
  become `Tuple`s.
- `Tuple` becomes a first-class value type.
- `[n]` on a `Tuple` is element access; on a `Series` it's history. The
  evaluator dispatches by type (§3.4 Indexing).
- The standalone core includes a small default `bb(period, multiplier)` as
  the first tuple-producing indicator. Talive-backed `macd`, `atr`, and `dmi`
  can be registered through the same public indicator API.
- Scalar indicators callable on `Series` (the chaining form
  `btc.rsi(14).sma(15)`).
- The scalar-indicator registry path is implemented; default EMA works on
  `CandleSeries`, candle-field `Series`, indicator-output `Series`, and
  tuple-element `Series`.
- Reserved constants: `CLOSE`, `OPEN`, `HIGH`, `LOW`, `HL2`, `HLC3`, `SMA`,
  `EMA`, `SMMA`, `WMA`, `DEMA`, `TEMA`, `NONE`, `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`,
  `MONTHLY`, `QUARTERLY`, `YEARLY`.
- Indicator kwarg config: `source=HLC3`, `ma=SMMA`, etc. with
  parse-time validation against the registry spec.

**Project's integration test:** an MACD-cross or BB-breakout program (the
§8.2 / §8.3 examples).

---

### Slice 7 — Math + TA helpers, helper registry

**Goal:** cleaner programs, second public registry API.

**Adds:**

- Full `math.*`: `max`, `min`, `abs`, `sqrt`, `pow`, `floor`, `ceil`,
  `round`.
- Full `ta.*`: `crossover`, `crossunder`, `rising`, `falling`, `highest`,
  `lowest`.
- Each helper has a registry entry that declares its lookback contribution
  (§4.2), feeding static buffer sizing.
- Helper registry public API:
  ```go
  type HelperSpec struct {
      Namespace string
      Name      string
      Args      []ArgSpec
      Lookback  func(args) map[seriesArg]int   // per-Series-arg lookback
      Eval      func(args) Value
  }
  reg.RegisterHelper(spec HelperSpec) error
  ```
- The `ta` namespace identifier becomes reserved.
- Project can register its own helpers under custom namespaces (subject to
  reserved-name rules).

---

### Slice 8 — Multi-input

**Goal:** cross-asset logic in one program.

**Adds:**

- Multiple `input <name>: <Type>` declarations.
- `PORT_DUPLICATE` parse error for any repeated top-level name (inputs,
  outputs, constants, functions share one namespace — §3.3).
- Wiring: `Launch` accepts `port_name → DataSource` for inputs and
  `port_name → Sink` for outputs. Missing input wiring produces
  `INPUT_NOT_WIRED` at launch. Output sinks are optional while using
  `DrainEvents()`, but `StrictOutputWiring` makes missing sinks produce
  `OUTPUT_NOT_WIRED`.
- The synchronizer that decides when `Run()` fires under multiple feeds
  lives **in the private project**, not in tascript. tascript exposes a
  simple "drive one tick now" entry point; the project wraps it.

**Project's integration test:** the §8.5 divergence example.

---

### Slice 9 — Time and Duration

**Goal:** time-aware filters and cooldowns.

**Adds:**

- `Time` and `Duration` value types.
- `Candle.ts`, `CandleSeries.timestamps[n]`.
- Time properties: `.year`, `.month`, `.day`, `.weekday`, `.hour`,
  `.minute`, `.second`, `.millisecond`, `.unix_ms`.
- Duration arithmetic per §3.5.
- The `time` namespace identifier and its constants (`time.MILLISECOND`
  through `time.WEEK`).

**Project's integration test:** the §8.3 BB-breakout-with-cooldown and
§8.4 weekday-filter examples.

---

### Slice 10 — Diagnostics polish + resource limits

**Goal:** production-quality error output and enforced caps.

**Adds:**

- Rust/Elm-style error rendering: file path, line, column, source line
  with caret highlight (§6.2).
- Configurable §7 resource limits enforced for source size, identifier length,
  string literal length, runtime string values, emit kwarg count, expression
  depth, diagnostic count, and history indexes.
- All §6.4 / §7 category codes wired through.
- Negative-sample test suite covering every category code.

---

### Stretch — beyond slice 10

Possibilities, ordered by likely value:

- User-defined functions (helper functions, not multiple Init/Run).
- `return` statement for early exit in `Run()` (surfaced as a gap in §8).
- Time-zone conversion (`time.in("America/New_York")`).
- String formatting (template literals, JS-style — direction noted in
  §5.3).
- More indicators (Anchored — VWAP, Pivot, ADR — once anchor wiring is
  designed).
- Type-level integer (`Int`) for indicator parameters and history bounds
  (the migration is intentionally cheap — see §3.4 numeric validation).

---

## Test corpus

The corpus grows alongside the slices. Layout:

```
tascript/
└── testdata/
    ├── slice0/
    │   ├── positive/
    │   │   └── greeting.tas + events.json
    │   └── negative/
    │       └── missing_init.tas + diagnostics.json
    ├── slice1/
    │   ├── positive/
    │   │   └── close_pipe.tas + feed.csv + events.json
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

Each slice's CI gate runs all slices' tests, ensuring earlier-slice
programs never regress.

## What to build first

Start and keep **Slice 0** on the compiler pipeline above. It has zero external
dependencies, drops a real public Go API the project can integrate against,
and leaves the parser/analyser/evaluator split ready for the next slices.
